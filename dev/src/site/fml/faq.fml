      <question>Why is jetty ignoring my changes?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          You probably ran mvn war:inplace in a previous build. This copies the
          compiled classes and third party libraries to
          main/src/webapp/WEB-INF/classes and main/src/webapp/WEB-INF/lib.
          Remove both directories, restart jetty, and it shuld work.

    <faq id="jetty-katari.properties-not-found">
      <question>
        Jetty is failing with file not found for katari.properties
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Jetty looks for katari.properties in the target directory.
          You must run 'mvn process-test-resources' (or any other goal that
          includes it) before running jetty:run.
