${symbol_dpound} Configures the location of the full text search indexes. By default, it uses
${symbol_dpound} target/compass and target/compass-tmp, wherever it happens to be. You need to
${symbol_dpound} configure this in production.
${symbol_pound} indexLocation.value=/home/tomcat/target/index
${symbol_pound} indexTempLocation.value=/home/tomcat/target/index-tmp

${symbol_dpound} Enables the runtime validation of html. This is usually very slow and not
${symbol_dpound} adequate for production.
htmlValidator.enabled=true

${symbol_dpound} Enables debug mode. The meaning of this flag is up to each module. For

${symbol_dpound} - The gadget container does not cache the gadget spec xml.
debugMode.value=true
