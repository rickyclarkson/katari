Katari - shindig integration

 Provides social features to a Katari based application.

Integration

* Activities

 Katari provides KatariActivityService, an implementation of shindig
 ActivityService, and the related Activity entities: KatariActivity and
 KataryMediaItem. These entities are all mapped with hibernate.

 As you can see, Katari uses the convention of prefixing 'Katari' to the name
 of the shindig interfase that it implements.
